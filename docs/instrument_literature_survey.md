# Literature Survey: Valid Instruments for Exogenous Commodity Price Shocks (2025 Context)

## Introduction to OPEC

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is a permanent intergovernmental organization founded in 1960 by Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, and Venezuela. Today, OPEC consists of 12 member countries mainly from Africa, the Middle East, and South America.

**Purpose:**  
OPEC coordinates and unifies petroleum policies among member countries to stabilize global oil markets. Its primary objectives are:
- Ensuring a regular supply of oil to consumers.
- Maintaining fair and stable prices for producers.
- Securing steady income for its members.

OPEC collectively regulates oil production quotas to influence global oil supply—and, consequently, market prices. It remains a leading player in the world energy market, headquartered in Vienna, Austria, and its cartel-like dynamics significantly impact international price volatility and trade flows.

## Valid Instruments from Literature

### Instrument 1: OPEC Production Quotas

- **Exogeneity:** Decisions regarding OPEC production quotas are determined by cartel members using internal and geopolitical criteria, independent of India's manufacturing or industrial output.  
- **Relevance:** OPEC quotas directly affect the amount of oil supplied globally, impacting international and domestic oil prices and, via input costs, India’s economic variables.
- **Literature Support:**  
    - *Hamilton (2009):* Demonstrates how OPEC-driven oil shocks impact global and domestic economies.  
    - *Kilian (2009):* Differentiates OPEC supply shocks from other types, underscoring their value as exogenous instruments.  
    - *Baumeister & Hamilton (2019):* Provides updated models of oil market shocks with OPEC events as valid instruments.
- **Expected First-Stage Relationship:**  
    - OPEC quota cuts (reductions) normally lead to higher oil prices—seen as a negative coefficient.

### Instrument 2: El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ONI Index)

- **Exogeneity:** ENSO events, measured by the ONI index, originate from global climate systems beyond India's economic or policy control.
- **Relevance:**  
    - El Niño episodes often cause droughts in South Asia, lowering crop yields and increasing commodity prices, especially for staples like wheat and rice.
- **Literature Support:**  
    - *Hsiang & Meng (2015):* Reviews climate impacts on agriculture, emphasizing tropical economics.  
    - *Dell et al. (2014):* Links weather shocks—including ENSO events—to macroeconomic outcomes.  
    - *Cashin et al. (2017):* Empirically quantifies how weather and climate shocks affect prices.
- **Expected First-Stage Relationship:**  
    - Positive ONI (El Niño phase) → higher food commodity prices (positive coefficient).

### Instrument 3: Rainfall Deviations (Standardized Anomalies)

- **Exogeneity:**  
    - Rainfall deviation metrics capture stochastic climate shocks in key agricultural regions, fundamentally disconnected from domestic economic activity.
- **Relevance:**  
    - Deviations—measured as anomalies—directly influence crop yields and local commodity prices, especially where monsoon rainfall is a main determinant.
- **Literature Support:**  
    - *Cashin et al. (2017)* and *Dell et al. (2014)* substantiate the use of rainfall and climate metrics as valid external instruments for commodity price analysis.
- **Expected First-Stage Relationship:**  
    - Negative rainfall anomalies (drought) → higher food prices; positive anomalies may moderate or decrease prices.

## 2025-Oriented Data Context

- **OPEC Quotas:** Recent quota reductions from 2023–2025 have led to elevated oil prices, with significant downstream effects for Indian import costs and industrial input prices.
- **ENSO (El Niño):** The strong 2023–2024 El Niño event contributed to widespread drought and commodity price volatility across Asia, impacting Indian agriculture and food markets.
- **Rainfall Deviations (India):** Monsoon seasons in 2024 and early 2025 saw record rainfall anomalies, resulting in substantial wheat, rice, and pulse price rises.
